    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Why might these features affect a passenger’s fare?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**  \n",
    "* Older passengers might have paid higher fares because greater life experience and accumulated wealth could make premium accommodations more affordable.  \n",
    "* There may also have been age-based pricing structures, with different rates for children and adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Family size**  \n",
    "* Larger families might receive group or family pricing, which could lower the fare per person.  \n",
    "* In contrast, families traveling together might require multiple cabins or larger spaces, increasing the total fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pclass (passenger class)**  \n",
    "* Passenger class is the most direct determinant of fare. First, second, and third class reflect very different levels of accommodation.  \n",
    "* First class included luxury cabins, fine dining, and premium services, while third class focused on basic transport in shared or dormitory-style spaces.  \n",
    "* Because class is tied to service level, it naturally creates clear price tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. List all available features\n",
    "\n",
    "* survived  \n",
    "* pclass  \n",
    "* sex  \n",
    "* age  \n",
    "* sibsp  \n",

    "* alive  \n",
    "* alone  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Which other features could improve predictions and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sex**  \n",
    "* Historical pricing practices and social norms might have influenced fares differently for men, women, and children.  \n",
    "* There may have been indirect effects of gender roles on cabin selection and travel patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embarked**  \n",
    "* Different departure ports (Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown) may have had different base prices.  \n",
    "* Regional economics, route segments, and port-specific taxes or fees could all affect fare levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deck**  \n",
    "* Cabin location is closely tied to value. Cabins on more desirable decks, closer to amenities or lifeboats, likely commanded higher fares.  \n",
    "* Certain decks were likely reserved for higher classes, reinforcing the link between deck and fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alone**  \n",
    "* Solo travelers may have faced single supplements for private cabins, while groups or families could benefit from shared accommodations.  \n",
    "* Pricing might differ for individuals versus group bookings, even within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How many variables are in your Case 4?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Case 4 includes **one** variable: `pclass` as the single predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Which variable did you choose for Case 4 and why does it make a good input?\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected **pclass (passenger class)** for Case 4 because it represents the core structure of Titanic pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clear class hierarchy**  \n",
    "  The ship used a three-class system, and fares were primarily driven by class of service. This creates natural and strong price segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Large price differences between classes**  \n",
    "  Fares for first class passengers were often several times higher than those for third class passengers. This strong separation supports predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accommodation and service quality**  \n",
    "  First class offered luxury suites and extensive services, while third class provided much more modest accommodations. Fare naturally reflects these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Historical consistency**  \n",
    "  Historical accounts show that passenger class was the main determinant of ticket price and revenue, making it a realistic and interpretable predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling results support this choice. Using only `pclass`, Case 4 achieved the highest test R² value (0.302) among all single-feature cases, confirming that passenger class is the strongest individual predictor of fare in this regression task and a solid baseline feature for further modeling.\n"

    "•\tPossible explanation:\n",

    "\n",
    "•\tWould more training data help?\n",

    "### 5.4 Polynomial Regression Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What patterns does the cubic model seem to capture?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cubic polynomial model captures the **non-linear** relationship between `pclass` and `fare`. Specifically, it reveals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1st class** passengers consistently have the **highest fares**, with substantial variability  \n",
    "- **2nd class** passengers show a moderate decrease in fare from 1st class  \n",
    "- **3rd class** passengers have the **lowest fares**, with relatively low variability  \n",
    "- The decline in fare from 1st → 3rd class forms a **curved, non-linear pattern**, not a simple straight line  \n",
    "- The curve helps describe the diminishing price differences between classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the cubic model identifies the **curved structure** of Titanic pricing more accurately than a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Where does it perform well or poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performs well:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capturing the overall **non-linear trend** in fares across classes  \n",
    "- Modeling the **general price drop** from 1st → 3rd class  \n",
    "- Representing the **central/typical fare values** within each class  \n",
    "- Handling areas where fare variation is modest (especially 2nd and 3rd class)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performs poorly:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting fares for **extreme outliers**, especially high-end 1st class luxury tickets  \n",
    "- Handling wide variability within 1st class where fares ranged dramatically  \n",
    "- Modeling occasional high fares in 2nd and 3rd class  \n",
    "- Capturing overlapping fare ranges between adjacent classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The model performs best for **general patterns**, not unusual or extreme cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Did the polynomial fit outperform linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the cubic polynomial performed **notably better** than linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Linear Regression | Polynomial (Degree 3) | Improvement |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **R²** | 0.302             | 0.336                  | +11 percent |\n",
    "| **RMSE** | 31.79           | 30.99                  | +2.5 percent |\n",
    "| **MAE** | 20.65            | 19.25                  | +6.8 percent |\n",
    "\n",
    "The cubic model captures extra curvature in the relationship between `pclass` and `fare` that the linear model cannot, resulting in improved predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Where does the cubic model fit best?\n",
    "\n",
    "The cubic polynomial model fits best for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Middle-range fares** within each passenger class  \n",
    "- **Typical observations** that follow expected class-based pricing patterns  \n",
    "- **2nd and 3rd class** passengers where fare variability is more limited  \n",
    "- The **overall decreasing trend** across classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where it struggles most:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-value 1st class outliers**, where special accommodations and unique cabin types created extremely high fares  \n",
    "- Regions with **dense variability**, especially among wealthier passengers  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the cubic model is effective at modeling the **general pricing structure** on the Titanic, but less effective at capturing **extreme or irregular fare cases**.  \n"

    "### 6.1 Summarize Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What features were most useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pclass** was by far the most useful feature, explaining around **30 percent** of the variance in fares (R² = 0.302). This strong predictive power aligns with the Titanic’s historical pricing structure, where passenger class directly dictated accommodation quality and service level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age** and **family_size** showed very limited predictive value  \n",
    "- Both produced R² values below **0.05**, indicating extremely weak relationships with fare\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What regression model performed best?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Elastic Net regression model** performed best overall when using `pclass` as the only predictor. It achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R² = 0.339**  \n",
    "- Slightly outperforming cubic polynomial regression (**R² = 0.336**)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net’s combination of **L1 and L2 regularization** allowed it to balance model complexity and stability more effectively than standard linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How did model complexity or regularization affect results?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization improved performance**  \n",
    "  Both Elastic Net and Ridge models performed slightly better than basic linear regression, indicating that small penalties helped stabilize the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polynomial complexity showed diminishing returns**  \n",
    "  While a cubic polynomial increased performance compared to a linear model, moving to a degree 5 polynomial did **not** further improve the R² score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simpler models generalized well**  \n",
    "  The single-feature `pclass` model showed nearly identical train and test results, indicating strong generalization and a well-captured underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Discuss Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Was fare hard to predict? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Fare was difficult to predict with high accuracy. Even the strongest model explained only about **34 percent** of the total variance. Several factors contributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wide price ranges within each class**  \n",
    "   Even among passengers in the same class, fares varied dramatically, implying other pricing factors were at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex historical pricing structure**  \n",
    "   Fare determination likely depended on cabin location, deck level, proximity to amenities, and even personal negotiation or booking circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing key features**  \n",
    "   Important predictors such as cabin number, exact berth type, ticket purchase date, and cabin size or layout were not available in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Did skew or outliers impact the models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, very significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fare distribution was **right-skewed** with several extreme outliers.  \n",
    "- Some 1st class passengers paid over **200 dollars**, while the majority paid under **50 dollars**.  \n",
    "- These outliers led to higher MAE and RMSE values and made prediction for high-fare passengers notably difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear-based models struggled at the high end of the fare distribution  \n",
    "- A single model for all passengers may not capture the complexity of pricing structures across classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested strategies for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "To better handle skew and outliers, future modeling could use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust regression methods** that are less sensitive to large errors  \n",
    "- **Separate models per passenger class**, capturing class-specific pricing patterns  \n",
    "- **Additional relevant features**, especially those related to cabin type, deck level, or booking details, to better explain high-end fare variation  \n"
